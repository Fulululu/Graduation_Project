# Remote Measurement and Control System
This project is my graduation design. A total of three parts.

## I. Environment:
#### Wireless Sensor network
ZStack2.5.1 on CC2530 board with BH1750,SHT10,DS18B20 and GY-69 using IAR Embedded Workbench7.3 for 8051.
#### TCP Communication
Server: Linux on Cloud Platform using python3.6.<br>
Client: Raspbian on Raspberry_Pi_3B+ using Python with pyserial modules.
#### Web Service
Linux on Cloud Platform using Django2.0.4 with django-el-pagination plugin.

    WHAT YOU NEED IS:
    1. copy server directory to your server.
    2. sudo apt install python3.6 (on your server)
    3. python(any version) -m pip install django django-el-pagination.(on your server)
    4. copy raspi directory to your raspberry pi
    5. pip install pyserial (on your raspberry pi)(note that pip is a softlink to python2.7 default)
    6. As for zigbee sensor environment, see other Internet blogs.


## II. Start to Use
Please follow this main startup step: Web service->myserver_asy->myclient->Zigbee Nodes

#### Wireless Sensor Network Detail
    1. Open project file
    2. Click Menu Project->Edit_Configurations, choose "EndDeviceEB" for Sensor device(choose "CoordinatorEB" for coordinator device)
    2. Click Menu Project->clean
    3. Click Menu Project->Rebuild_all
    4. Click Menu Project->Download_and_Debug
    5. Let it run

#### TCP Communication Detail
    Server:
    1. cd server/socket/
    2. python3.6 myserver_asy.py

    Client:
    1. cd raspi/
    2. python myclient.py
    3. type your account and password that register in Web server

#### Web Service Detail
    1. add your E-mail to EMAIL_HOST_USER and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD in server/mysite/mysite/setting.py
    2. cd server/mysite/
    3. python manage runserver yourserverip:yourserverport
    4. open your browser and type the url(ip:port)
    5. using "python keygen_client.py" to generate an invitation code
    6. register an account and login to use.
